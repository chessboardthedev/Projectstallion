# Project Stallion
A PHP based status page that allows anyone to set up their own status page for their server.

##Warning
I recommend that you host this on another server, other than you main server. Incase, the main server goes down, you can still have the status page up and update your users on the situation. In the future, I will be making a automated hosting for this. For now, it will have to be self hosted.
